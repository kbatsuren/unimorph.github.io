# General Information
The seminar will focus on development of consistent cross-linguistic annotation for Universal Dependencies and UniMorph. 




# Keynote Speakers

-- Khuyagbaatar Batsuren

-- Reut Tsarfaty

# Agenda

We propose using Jamboard during the seminar: [https://jamboard.google.com/d/1EVw2bq7Toff6C6yGwUm-XOTdyAzX8TpWeYU9YL7_00I/edit?usp=sharing](https://jamboard.google.com/d/1EVw2bq7Toff6C6yGwUm-XOTdyAzX8TpWeYU9YL7_00I/edit?usp=sharing)

1. Discussion of annotation schemas for UniMorh and Universal Dependencies:

  - Annotation consistency
  
  - UD <---> UM interface


2. Derivational vs. Inflectional Morphology:
  
  - Incorporation of derivational morphology into UM (derivational paradigms)

  - Paradigms that incorporate both inflectional and derivation word formation (as in Polish)

  - Polysynthetic languages

3. Demonstration session:  WebUI for UniMorph annotation [http://unimorph.ethz.ch/](http://unimorph.ethz.ch/)

4. MWEs in paradigms:

  - Annotation of clitics

  - Annotation of MWEs that require dependencies

5. Administrative session:

  - A pipeline for publication & incorporation of new languages

  - Linguistic working groups and their management

  - UM Schema updates & maintaining its documentation (wiki format?)
