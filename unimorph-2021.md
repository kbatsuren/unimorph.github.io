# Agenda

We propose using Jamboard during the seminar: [https://jamboard.google.com/d/1EVw2bq7Toff6C6yGwUm-XOTdyAzX8TpWeYU9YL7_00I/edit?usp=sharing](https://jamboard.google.com/d/1EVw2bq7Toff6C6yGwUm-XOTdyAzX8TpWeYU9YL7_00I/edit?usp=sharing)

1. Discussion of annotation schemas for UniMorph and Universal Dependencies:

    - Annotation consistency
  
    - UD <---> UM interface


2. Derivational vs. Inflectional Morphology:
  
    - Incorporation of derivational morphology into UM (derivational paradigms)

    - Paradigms that incorporate both inflectional and derivation word formation (as in Polish)

    - Polysynthetic languages

3. Demonstration session:  WebUI for UniMorph annotation [http://unimorph.ethz.ch/](http://unimorph.ethz.ch/)

4. MWEs in paradigms:

    - Annotation of clitics

    - Annotation of MWEs that require dependencies

5. Administrative session:

    - A pipeline for publication & incorporation of new languages

    - Linguistic working groups and their management

    - UM Schema updates & maintaining its documentation (wiki format?)
